# Reterminating-Cable-Adventures

After experiencing some connectivity issues, I decided I wanted to clean up the demarc point for my fiber connection. As you can see, it was a little untidy from the initial installation - I was surprised it was left like this.

The patch cable from the terminal to the wall had A LOT of extra cable so shortening that up would be important. I also wanted to get a tighter termination on the structured cable keystone in case that would reduce interference.
